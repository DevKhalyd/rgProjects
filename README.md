# rg_projects

These are my projects. I try to do complex projects to improve my skills as Flutter Developer.

Also here I'm not pretending to create the design with a specific architecture or with a dessign pattern.
My goal is to understand how the animations and complex designs interact with each other.

If you want to see how I implement the Clean Architecture or the MVVM you can see my profile in GitHub to explore all my projects on backend and mobile.

TODO: Create a Index of the applications

## Topics to learn in deep

Transform Widget

Hero Animation

Slives like Twitter profile. Relates to Hero Animation

Payment processors like stripe

Background Services

Notifications for IOS and Android more customize

I think with those topics learned I'll be closer to be a senior in Flutter
