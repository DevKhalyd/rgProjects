These are my projects. I try to do complex projects to improve my skills as Flutter Developer.

Also here I'm not pretending to create the design with a specific architecture or with a dessign pattern.
My goal is to understand how the animations and complex designs interact with each other.

If you want to see how I implement the Clean Architecture or the MVVM you can see my profile in GitHub to explore all my projects on backend and mobile.

1.3 Check the functionality from left to up

2. Mix with the user's input and react to the user's interactions

## Topics to learn in deep

Transform Widget

Hero Animation

Slives like Twitter profile

Payment processors like stripe

Background Services

Notifications for IOS and Android more customize

I think with those topics learned I'll be closer to be a senior
