# rg_projects

These are my projects. I try to do complex projects to improve my skills as Flutter Developer.

Also here I'm not pretending to create the design with a specific architecture or with a dessign pattern.
My goal is to understand how the animations and complex designs interact with each other.

If you want to see how I implement the Clean Architecture or the MVVM you can see my profile in GitHub to explore all my projects on backend and mobile.

Add a description where I describe what I wanted to learn in this app

## TODO

### Basic

1. Add the input with the the design done already (First create another one to handle the animations and then reply the same widgets in the new one)

2. Get the size of the keyboard to do when this one is open

3. Create the second state of the user's input and hanle with the same controller of the button

### Complex - Left Animation

1. Shime, Counter and Icon with a fade animation

2. When the button is almost in the limit make the trash animation.

### Complex - Up Animation

1. Create the animation of the lock

2. React to the animation

## Topics to learn in deep

Transform Widget

Hero Animation

Slives like Twitter profile

Payment processors like stripe

Background Services

Notifications for IOS and Android more customize

I think with those topics learned I'll be closer to be a senior in Flutter
